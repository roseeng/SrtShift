00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:01,160
This programme contains scenes of
violence and strong language.

00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,568
NARRATOR: 'Day 64.

3
00:00:24,568 --> 00:00:27,488
'2.36pm.

4
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:31,848
'Space is in the Biodome.

5
00:00:31,848 --> 00:00:36,567
'Marky and Veronica are by the pool.

6
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:40,287
'Joplin and Pippa are at the sofas.'

7
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:43,327
I mean, you know,
what is TV, anyway?

8
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:47,407
It's just a big fat arrow
pointing away from the problem.

9
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:49,687
Especially shows like this.

10
00:00:50,847 --> 00:00:55,167
It's like the lead in the water pipes
that sent the Romans mad.

11
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:57,727
Mmm.

12
00:00:57,727 --> 00:01:01,047
I thought to myself,
"OK, I can ignore it,

13
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:04,767
"or I can engage with
and alter it from within."

14
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:09,807
You know, and if just one person
hears me and thinks, "Wow.

15
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:12,767
"I never saw it like that.
This guy's really opened my head,"

16
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:15,007
then I've justified doing it.

17
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:16,447
You know?

18
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:20,727
Do toes have bones in them?

19
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:27,246
Grayson and Angel
are in the diary room.

20
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:28,726
- (Big Brother) Hello, Grayson.
- Hi, Big Brother.

21
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:30,126
- Hello, Angel.
- All right.

22
00:01:30,126 --> 00:01:32,566
- How are you today?
- I'm pissed off and I'm angry,

23
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:34,166
and we need your permission
to kill someone.

24
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,646
Who would you like to kill?

25
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:36,486
Who do you think? Wonderbra.

26
00:01:36,486 --> 00:01:38,006
And her spastic henchman.

27
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:41,726
All right, so show me M and V looking
really pleased with themselves, OK?

28
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,246
The chavvier the better.

29
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:47,286
And lose "spastic", otherwise Ofcom
will be shitting blood for a week.

00:01:47,286 --> 00:01:48,806
VIDEO REWINDS

31
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:51,086
- Who do you think? Wonderbra.
- And her henchman.

32
00:01:51,086 --> 00:01:53,326
- Good.
- (Grayson) And last night,
you could hear everything.

33
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:55,326
It sounded like someone
spanking a wet rat!

34
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:56,886
(Angel) And who needs to hear that?

35
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:58,926
They even sound thick
when they grunt.

36
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:01,726
OK, so mark that
for their best bits.

37
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:02,806
Patrick.

38
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:04,526
- Thanks...uh, what is it?
- Kelly.

39
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:06,246
- That's the one.
- They only had blueberry muffins.

40
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:07,846
- Oi, oi, oi. Fat camp!
- Oh, that's lovely.

41
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:10,126
PHONE RINGS
I need this in 20 minutes.

42
00:02:10,126 --> 00:02:12,566
If you're gonna answer that, make
it quick. Chloe's looking for you.

43
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,365
- Yep, I'm on it.
- Quick!

44
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:16,445
- Shit. Shit.
- You ignoring that, are you?

45
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:18,765
- It's Riq.
- Oh, asking where you were last
night?

46
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,245
- I told him.
- (You told him?)

47
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:21,805
- Well, texted him.
- Well, what did you say?

48
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:23,365
I crashed at yours.

49
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:26,565
OK. Glossed over
a couple of details, then.

50
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:28,365
Yeah, me and Riq
have been together for ages.

51
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:30,085
It's not my usual style, you know?

52
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,605
You got pissed,
you put your hand in the cookie jar.

53
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:35,405
You make it sound so innocent.
LAUGHING

54
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,845
Yeah, but was it?

55
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:43,925
I will be back later
for the highlights, you jammy cow.

56
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:48,965
Hiya. That's your coffee.

57
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:50,605
- Heya.
- Hey.

58
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:53,045
Listen, what happened last night
was a mistake.

59
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:55,645
- Yeah, it was...
- We must be really stupid

60
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:58,045
cos we kept repeating the same
mistake till, what, half three?

61
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,485
Yeah, thereabouts.

62
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,525
Yeah, cos I like to learn
from my mistakes

63
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:03,565
and I don't think
we fully went through

64
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:05,684
all the possible avenues
for error, so...

65
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:07,164
Dick!

66
00:03:07,164 --> 00:03:09,724
I'd like to go over it
with you later, see if we can...

67
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:13,204
(Clears throat)

68
00:03:13,204 --> 00:03:15,204
Can you take Aisleyne
to the BBLB room?

69
00:03:16,524 --> 00:03:18,284
Um, that's Sophie's job.

70
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:20,124
Yeah, she's still doing
friends and family.

71
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:21,724
Fine.

72
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:26,244
When you're done with that, coffee,
camera run, they're gasping.

73
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:28,124
(Kelly) Sorry, it's been
a bit hectic here today.

74
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,524
There's champagne and stuff and tea
in the room. It's gonna be great.

75
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:33,044
Hey, Aisleyne.

76
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:35,324
- Hello.
- Everything all right, yeah?

77
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:36,964
Looking after you OK?

78
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:39,804
- (Aisleyne) Who was that?
- (Kelly) Patrick, producer.

79
00:03:45,764 --> 00:03:47,524
- Do you want me to fire you?
- Shit!

80
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:49,484
Um, sorry, man.

81
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:51,004
Man? Just do your job.

82
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:53,844
There's no-one even there.
Move the camera.

83
00:03:53,844 --> 00:03:55,284
Oh, Jesus Christ.

84
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:58,483
TV: ..volleys of gunfire. We hope
to join them again for an update...

85
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:00,843
(Newsreader) 'Authorities say they
cannot guarantee the safety...'

86
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:03,403
(Voicemail) 'Hi, this is Kelly.
Not here to take your call right now,

87
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:05,803

I'll get back to you.

88

(Brian Belo) How you doin', fellas?

97
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:32,243
Do you believe in reincarnation?

98
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:33,803
Can't knock it, can you?

99
00:04:33,803 --> 00:04:35,883
I'll show you a good book
that I'm reading.

100
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:45,763
Doing up my button.
Thank you, sweetheart.

101
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:49,362
(Patrick) Get your fucking baps
out of that chair. Now!

102
00:04:50,682 --> 00:04:53,442
37 minutes to go, minions.

103
00:04:53,442 --> 00:04:55,482
Do you even know what a minion is?

104
00:04:55,482 --> 00:04:57,442
No? Don't look offended, then.

105
00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:58,842
Where's Sophie?

106
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:02,242
Anybody know where Sophie is? Hello?

107
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:05,162
Excuse me. Come on.
Gormless! Where's Sophie?

108
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:07,602
Uh, Sophie.
Uh, she's picking up Pippa's mum.

109
00:05:07,602 --> 00:05:10,642
Well, fucking hell! She should have
been here by 5.00. Get her for me.

110
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:12,162
- Sorry.
- What's the latest?

111
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:15,882
Um, numbers are way down. There
are network issues or something.

112
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,642
- OK, so the headline is...?
- Well, Grayson is safe.

113
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:19,322
Marky is the favourite for the chop,

114
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:21,362
but there's only a pixel
between him and Pippa.

115
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,322
Oh, God. Well, rather her than him.

116
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:26,882
Look at that.
Face like a Manchester morgue.

117
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:29,722
Wish they'd nominate you,
sour flaps.

120
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,162
Is that your eviction outfit?

121
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:40,241
Oi, Barbra. I said,
is that your eviction outfit?

122
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:42,321
My name is Grayson.

123
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:44,601

Oooh, Claire. Voice of God.

126
00:05:58,281 --> 00:05:59,961
This is Big Brother.

127
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:01,801
Could Grayson come to the diary room?

128
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:02,841
- Ha!
- What?!

129
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:05,201
- He started it!
- Oh, "He started it"!

130
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:06,281
Oh, you're such an idiot.

131
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:08,681
(THEY ALL ARGUE)

132
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:11,001
- You wanna drown me?
- You should come with subtitles.

133
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:16,481
Fucking had it
with this northern twat.

134
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:19,041
Fuckin' hell!

135
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,481
Oh, God.
Talk about pleased with himself.

136
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:24,601
It's just post-shag euphoria.

137
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,041
You remember that.

138
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,961
- What are you for?
- It's Sophie.

139
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
Tell me you are round the corner.

140
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,120
'Sorry, Patrick.'

141
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,480
All the main routes were chocka.

142
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,040
Col's trying to work
some back-road magic now.

143
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,680
You were supposed to be here...
fucking three hours ago.

144
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,960
- Yes.
- Stop saying yes.

145
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,480
'Right. Mm-hm. Yep.'

146
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,360
Now, you should have been here
three hours ago,

147
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,920
'in friends and family,
in hospitality,'

148
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,760
with that fucking moaning
Scottish bird's mother.

149
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,720
'Fucking sick of this!'

150
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,000
Fucking get back here, pronto!

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,760
No.

152
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,320
Pick that up.

153
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,520
Your boss isn't upset, I hope.

154
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,240
It's eviction night,
so he's a bit stressed.

155
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,520
(Woman) It's a very stressful line
of work. I've often thought that.

156
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,880
What's that?

157
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,879
SQUELCHING

158
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,679
Right. Shit. Bye. Fuck.

159
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:40,599
(Fucking hell.)

160
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:43,119
- Claire.
- Yeah?

161
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,279
They might bump tonight's show.

162
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,119
- Why?
- Because of this shit.

163
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,479
One fucking estate on fire
in Newcastle

164
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,719
and a couple of policemen
killed in Liverpool.

165
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:56,799
Oh, Jesus.

166
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:59,359
Stockwell, Cardiff, Portsmouth,
all bollocksed.

167
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:03,199
If this gets much worse, we are
gonna be bumped for a news update.

168
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,919
(Claire) Brilliant.

169
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,119
(Patrick) Why do people riot,
anyway? It's not the '80s.

170
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,359
You know, they've got distractions.
They should stay in, watch telly.

171
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:28,598
Just...that hat is so loud.

172

..and the cameras ain't moving.

526
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:45,609
Big Brother ain't watching us.

527
00:35:36,088 --> 00:35:37,328
Come on, man!

528
00:35:37,448 --> 00:35:38,568
I need a Pepsi Max.

529
00:35:47,488 --> 00:35:48,648
(mouths)

530
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:55,408
LAUGHTER

531
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,808
Wooo!

532
00:35:57,648 --> 00:35:59,008
Woo-hoo!

533
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:02,008
Ow! Ow!

534
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:31,898
(Veronica) This ain't right.
No cameras, no fucking point.

535
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,778
- (Marky) They might be broken.
- (Joplin) All of them?

536
00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:36,738
- Could be electrics.
- They're doing it on purpose.

537
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:39,217
- Yeah, like a task.
- Where the cameras don't move?

538
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:40,697
Like that's gonna be entertaining.

539
00:36:40,697 --> 00:36:43,457
(Joplin) They want to see how we
react to an absence of authority.

540
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:45,297
Well, it's freaking me right out.

541
00:36:45,297 --> 00:36:47,457
That's what they want.
Don't give it to them.

542
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:50,257
- We're not freaked out!
- I am!

543
00:36:56,377 --> 00:37:00,337
MUFFLED ARGUING

544
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:11,377
(Veronica) Give me the answer.
Tell me what's going on.

545
00:37:11,377 --> 00:37:13,017
(Angel) Big Brother, man,
what the fuck...?

546
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:16,257
(Veronica) Look, we've been
really good, playing games.

547
00:37:16,257 --> 00:37:18,337
We just wanna know what's going on.

548
00:37:21,297 --> 00:37:22,457
(Veronica) Hello?

549
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:25,377
(Angel) If the cameras don't start
moving any minute, I'm walking.

550
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:26,817
Remember I told you...

551
00:37:31,176 --> 00:37:33,056
- I'm going on the roof.
- We're not allowed there!

552
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,696
Exactly! If they don't stop me,
we'll know something's wrong.

553
00:37:36,696 --> 00:37:38,536
MUFFLED TALKING

554
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:09,456
SCREAMING

555
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:13,936
SCREAMING

556
00:38:41,415 --> 00:38:42,975
(Grayson) They'll throw you out!

557
00:38:42,975 --> 00:38:45,375
Just leave him!
Let 'em throw him out!

558
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,535
(Angel) You know what? Fuck 'em.

559
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:49,655
- (Grayson) Oh, my God!
- (Veronica) Look!

560
00:38:49,655 --> 00:38:52,295
(Veronica) That's what it is!
They've given us a new housemate!

561
00:38:52,295 --> 00:38:54,455
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

562
00:38:54,455 --> 00:38:55,935
Oh, fucking hell. Unbelievable!

563
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:59,495
See, I told you!

564
00:38:59,495 --> 00:39:01,415
(Veronica) Course it is!
Look at her!

565
00:39:01,415 --> 00:39:04,575
- She's a bit strange.
- What's your name, then?

566
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,255
- (Marky) Uh...
- (Angel) Coo-ee! Hello!

567
00:39:07,255 --> 00:39:09,135
LAUGHING

568
00:39:09,135 --> 00:39:10,614
What's she doing?

569
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:13,334
Hello?

570
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:20,334
Fine. Whatever.

571
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:22,654
- Are you a mong?
- Shh! She might be.

572
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:24,374
(Angel) Is that fake blood on her?

573
00:39:24,374 --> 00:39:27,294
(Grayson) Don't listen to them.
They're idiots, sweetheart.

574
00:39:27,294 --> 00:39:29,534
- I wouldn't bother, Gray.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

575
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,734
(Marky) Let Joppers in.
Come on, Jops.

576
00:39:31,734 --> 00:39:33,294
Um, "hello".

577
00:39:33,294 --> 00:39:36,974
My "name" is Joplin.

578
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,574
SNIGGERING

579
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:40,894
And I'm "happy" to "meet you".

580
00:39:43,374 --> 00:39:46,094
- There's one in there.
- One what?

581
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:48,614
(Grayson) Have you been outside
all this time?

582
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:50,854
Can I ask you a question?

583
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:53,854
- How am I coming across?
- (Marky) Oh, you big queen.

584
00:39:53,854 --> 00:39:56,414
- Am I popular?
- Yeah, you're the favourite.

585
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:58,374
Ha! No autographs for you.
Hear that? I'm the favourite!

586
00:39:58,374 --> 00:40:00,294
- This is such a put-on this!
- Is that fake blood?

587
00:40:00,294 --> 00:40:02,773
Shut up.

588
00:40:02,773 --> 00:40:05,333
You must try harder.
LAUGHING

589
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:07,693
- I said shut up!
- (Grayson) All right.

590
00:40:07,693 --> 00:40:09,373
She's mental. Look at her.
Her mechanism's gone.

591
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:13,133
(Angel) It's just attention-seeking.
Ignore her, she'll stop.

592
00:40:37,453 --> 00:40:39,653
GROWLING
Fuck.

593
00:40:41,693 --> 00:40:44,653
Jesus. Fuck!

594
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:47,133
GROWLING

595
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:50,373
Fuck.

596
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:05,292
(Marky) Did they give you
specific instructions,

597
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:07,292
or just tell you to come in
and act weird?

598
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:11,852
- I'm not acting. I work here.
- What, as a window-cleaner?

599
00:41:13,612 --> 00:41:16,052
Something's happening.
Some sort of outbreak.

600
00:41:16,052 --> 00:41:17,892
- Oh, here we go.
- Just let her talk.

601
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,132
OK. Go on.

602
00:41:19,132 --> 00:41:21,772
- People get this thing.
- Thing?

603
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,812
They wanna kill you,
and they change.

604
00:41:25,812 --> 00:41:28,332
And then their bums fall off.
LAUGHING

605
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:31,412
- What do you mean, they change?
- I dunno. They're dead.

606
00:41:31,412 --> 00:41:33,412
- Dead?
- Sorry, what did you say?

607
00:41:35,732 --> 00:41:37,892
They're dead.

608
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:41,572
They're dead,
and they're still alive.

609
00:41:41,572 --> 00:41:43,132
They're everywhere.

610
00:41:43,132 --> 00:41:44,651
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

611
00:41:44,651 --> 00:41:46,571
- There's one in here.
- This is quality, this is.

612
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,451
Hammer House of horseshit.

613
00:41:48,451 --> 00:41:50,051
You're brilliant, you.

614
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,851
Come on, now. That's enough.

615
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:54,331
GROWLING AND SNIFFING

616
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:06,171
LOW GROWLING

617
00:42:11,451 --> 00:42:13,171
Oh, dear.

618
00:42:13,171 --> 00:42:15,211
GROWLING

619
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:21,051
SCREAMING
Oh, fuck!

620
00:42:21,051 --> 00:42:23,771
Not you! Fuck, not you!

621
00:42:26,131 --> 00:42:27,651
SCREAMING
Fuck, shut up!

622
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:29,931
Shut up!
ROARING

623
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,570
Is that Davina?

624
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:44,730
Sort of.

625
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,570
Get off my fucking suit.

626
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,250
(Joplin) Dear Big Brother,
may I say how impressed I was

627
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,450
at your inclusion of a clearly
mentally unhinged woman

628
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,210
into the house?

629
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,730
Maybe something has happened.

630
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,370
(Veronica) I just wanna know, is
that fake blood? I just wanna know.

631
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,850
(Joplin) Even if she's not mentally
ill, this is in very poor taste.

632
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,730
(Marky) You seriously think
there's a bunch of dead biffers

633
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,330
strolling about, eating people?

634
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,490
They're coming to get you, Barbara.
MANIC LAUGHING

635
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,890
Well, I just want it noted
that I do not approve of this.

636
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,970
Shut up! Shut up,
you fucking idiots!

637
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:25,649
You fucking idiots! I'm trying
to tell you there's one in there!

638
00:43:25,649 --> 00:43:28,409
INDISTINCT YELLING

639
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:31,769
YELLING
Calm down. Just calm down.

640
00:43:31,769 --> 00:43:33,809
KNOCKING
(Marky) Oi, mate! Mate!

641
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:37,569
You're live on Channel 4!
Don't swear or say "fuck" or nothing!

642
00:43:37,569 --> 00:43:39,449
Maybe he's deaf and dead.

643
00:43:41,649 --> 00:43:44,729
Hello? Hello?

644
00:43:44,729 --> 00:43:46,329
No, can't hear anything.

645
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:48,409
Don't do that.
(Marky) There's nothing here.

646
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:50,729
(Veronica) Marky, get away
from that. It's the fire exit.

647
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:52,209
Don't open that door.

648
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:54,169
What, this door?

649
00:43:54,169 --> 00:43:56,369
- Open that door and I'll stab you.
- What?

650
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:59,609
Marky, don't wind her up.
Seriously, she's fucking weird.

651
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:02,329
Shut the door!
(Angel) Shut the door!

652
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:04,009
Shut the fucking door!

653
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:06,809
- Close it! Fucking close the door!
- Marky, close it.

654
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:08,929
You fucking well
better close the fucking door!

655
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:11,809
All right! Fucking hell!

656
00:44:14,689 --> 00:44:17,368
What you gonna do with them?

657
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:19,808
Sorry. I'm just having a look.

658
00:44:22,768 --> 00:44:27,288
SCREAMING

659
00:45:06,648 --> 00:45:08,767
In the head.

660
00:45:08,767 --> 00:45:10,327
You've got to get them in the head.
